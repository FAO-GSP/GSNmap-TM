# Step 2: environmental covariates


## Environmental covariates

The SCORPAN equation (Eq. \ref{eq:scorpan}) refers to the soil-forming factors that determine the spatial variation of soils. However, these factors cannot be measured directly. Instead, proxies of these soil forming factors are used. One essential characteristic of the environmental covariates is that they are spatially explicit, covering the whole study area. Table 2 shows a summary of the environmental covariates that can be implemented under the DSM framework.

Apart from the environmental covariates mentioned in Table \ref{tab:covs}, other types of maps could also be included, such as Global Surface Water Mapping Layers and Water Soil Erosion from the Joint Research Centre (JRC). At national level there may be very significant covariates that could complement or replace the covariates of Table \ref{tab:covs}. 

Since environmental covariates are available at different resolutions and coordinate reference systems (CRS), they have to be harmonised at a common resolution and CRS. The target resolution in GSNmap is 250 m x 250 m, therefore, all covariates were aggregated (from higher to lower resolution) or disaggregated (from lower to higher resolution) to 250 m. This process involved a raster resampling method, which is usually implemented by a bilinear approach for continuous covariates, and by the nearest-neighbour approach for categorical covariates (not included in the current list). 

Note that the target resolution of GSNmap has been set at 250 m, which can be considered a moderate resolution for a global layer. However, those countries that require a higher resolution are free to develop higher resolution maps and aggregate the resulting maps to the target resolution of GSNmap for submission. 

## Reducing collinearity in environmental covariates

Multicollinearity is usually present in remote sensing data and terrain attributes. While this was an issue for multiple linear regression models, current models such as random forest can deal with high dimensionality. However, the main reasons to reduce the number of environmental covariates are that a model with fewer predictors can be interpreted more easily, thus extracting new knowledge, redundant information increasing the computational demand, and improve prediction results [@Behrens2014]. 

Covariate selection can be done by supervised or unsupervised methods [@Behrens2010]. Supervised methods work on the basis of prediction results, hence they are based on a given dataset. For instance, recursive feature elimination (RFE) in caret R package [@Kuhn2022] provides a tool for selecting covariates according to their predicting contribution. Instead, unsupervised methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by removing redundant information without taking into account a particular target variable. Principal component analysis is one of the most widely used for this purpose, however, it does not ensure that specific discriminant features are kept within the main factors [@Behrens2014]. Another drawback of this technique is that model interpretation can be reduced when using factors instead of the original covariates.

## Merging soil data and environmental covariates

A calibration dataset consists of soil observations and a matrix of predictors, where each row is a soil observation paired with the values of the corresponding covariates for the given spatial location. Some common issues and solution when merging soil observations and covariates are:

* Mismatch of coordinate reference system (CRS): it requires to convert the CRS of point data to the raster or polygon covariate CRS.
* Categorical covariates: some covariates may be categorical, such as land use/cover, legacy soil maps or geological maps. A common problem in this case is that some classes may not be sampled with any soil observation, causing an error when using the layer for prediction, since the model cannot predict over a class that was not part of the model calibration step. Also, because of the cross-validation procedure, it is advised to have, at least, three soil samples per class for the same reason.
