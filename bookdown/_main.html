<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Foreword</h1>
<p>This document presents the technical details of the first ever
country-driven global soil organic carbon map (GSOCmap). This map allows
the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30 cm. It represents a key
contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1,
which defines the area of degraded land. The novelty of this map is the
fact that it is the first ever global soil organic carbon assessment
which is produced through a participatory approach. Countries developed
their capacities and stepped up efforts to compile or collect all
available soil information at the national level.<br />
The 5th GSP Plenary Assembly, in June 2017, approved the decision of
member countries jointly developing a GSOCmap as a baseline for the
amount and distribution of SOC soils. This map is part of the process of
building a Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) under the 4th pillar
of the GSP, which aims to enhance the quantity and quality of soil data
and information. This considerable effort, which led to the launch of
the GSOCmap on World Soil Day 2017 (5 December), is paving the way to
the establishment of national soil information systems and represents
the first step toward introducing a soil monitoring program.<br />
This technical report is aimed at scientists. It provides guidance on
the process that led to the establishment of the GSOCmap and on how to
use it. The map provides users with useful information to monitor the
soil condition, identify degraded areas, set restoration targets,
explore SOC sequestration potentials, support the greenhouse gas
emission reporting under the UNFCCC. It also provides users with crucial
information that is needed to make evidence based decisions to mitigate
and adapt to climate change.<br />
We can expect that the extensive data content of more than 1 million
sampling points resulting from country contributions and the interactive
nature of the GSOCmap will greatly assist in the process of building a
global soil information system, which in turn will help contribute in
the achievement of the sustainable development goals.<br />
We are proud to make this very first edition of the global soil organic
carbon map technical summary available for the international scientific
community, and we hope that this map will be a major step in combating
not only climate change which is directly linked to soil organic carbon,
but also poverty, hunger and malnutrition.<br />
The contributing institutions from the participating countries which
submitted their maps or data are listed in Appendix
<a href="#chap:countries" reference-type="ref" reference="chap:countries"><span class="math display">\[chap:countries\]</span></a>.<br />
This technical report is a companion report to the GSOCmap V1.5.0. It

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The importance of soil organic carbon</h2>
<p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the main component of soil organic matter
(SOM) and is a crucial contributor to food production, mitigation and
adaption to climate change, and the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). SOC affects most of the processes relevant to
soil functions and food production. A high SOM, and therefore SOC
content provides plants with the nutrients and water they need by
increasing soil fertility and water availability, which in turn improve
food productivity. SOC has also long been used as an indicator of soil
health, due to its capacity to improve soil structural stability, which
affects porosity, aeration and water filtration capacities to supply
clean water. However, SOC mineralization can be an important source of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This means that changing SOM (and hence
SOC) not only changes the provision of ecosystem services required for
crop production, but also affects soils’ capacity to buffer against
environmental changes, as it regulates the resilience agricultural
systems to climate change.<br />
SOC has received great attention during the development of the
greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting programme of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) since the mid-nineties. This was done to
address the contribution of intensive land management and the vast
amount of degraded land to greenhouse gas emissions, since these have
caused tremendous historic losses of SOC, resulting in high potentials
for future carbon storage. Recently, an increasing number of authors
have stressed the crucial role of healthy soils, with soil carbon being
the most important indicator for food security and resilience against
climate change. This has led to above and below ground carbon (SOC)
becoming sub-indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
target 15.3.1 (Proportion of land that is degraded over total land
area).<br />
The Status of the World’s Soil Resources (SWRS) report highlights that,
although more carbon is stored in the soil than in the atmosphere and
plant life combined, a large portion (33%) of the world’s soils are
degraded, which has led to a major loss of global SOC reserves. The
reversal of soil degradation through the buildup of SOM and the
sustainable management of soils therefore offers large potential to
contribute to climate change mitigation by sequestering atmospheric
carbon into the soil. This emphasizes that soil can be a double-edged
sword when it comes to carbon fluxes, as it can either be a net sink or
a net source of GHGs depending on soil management practices.<br />
Despite the current focus on SOC, knowledge about SOC baselines and
changes, and the detection of vulnerable hot spots for SOC losses and
gains under climate change and changed land management are still fairly
limited. Accurate SOC baselines are still needed for many countries, and
estimates about the role of soils in the global carbon cycle are
currently only based on rough estimates, which results in large
uncertainties. Global SOC estimates exist, but there is high variability
in reported values among authors, caused by the diversity of different
data sources and methodologies used to calculate and measure these
estimates <span class="citation">(Henry, Valentini, and Bernoux 2009; Köchy, Hiederer, and Freibauer 2015)</span>.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Objectives of soil carbon mapping</h2>
<p>The Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) and the GSP
Secretariat were asked by the Science-Policy Interface (SPI) of the
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to share
information about the possible pathways to support the SDG 15.3.1
indicator on SOC. During the 5th Session of the ITPS held during March
2016, collaboration between the ITPS and the SPI of the UNCCD, the
Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
(IPBES), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
discussed. The GSP/ITPS were requested to conduct a global SOC
assessment based on country-level spatial soil data sets, combined into
a new global SOC map. This task would directly relate to SDG 15.3.1, and
would also support the endorsed metrics for the assessment of land
degradation neutrality (LDN) <span class="citation">(FAO and GSP 2016b)</span>. The preparation of the
GSOCmap was discussed and supported to the 4th and 5th GSP Plenary
Assembly <span class="citation">(FAO and GSP 2016a, 2017a)</span>.<br />
As it was approved by the decision of the 5th GSP Plenary Assembly, June
2017 <span class="citation">(FAO and GSP 2017a)</span>, GSP members agreed to jointly develop a global SOC map as
the zero status for the amount and distribution of SOC in soils around
the world. This map was developed following the general GSP principle of
being a country-driven initiative. It is a part of the process to build
a Global Soil Information System under GSP Pillar 4 (Enhance the
quantity and quality of soil data and information: data collection
(generation), analysis, validation, reporting, monitoring and
integration with other disciplines).<br />
The development of a global soil organic carbon map using a
country-driven approach provides and builds on synergies with ongoing
and new reporting needs, data sharing obligations, and therefore
benefits activities at national, regional and global levels.
Particularly to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable training for countries in need of technical support
(e.g. regarding the collection, statistical evaluation and modeling
of SOC data);</p></li>
<li><p>Develop data infrastructure to update the SWRS report on SOC through
a country-driven baseline, and initiate future assessments of SOC
changes;</p></li>
<li><p>Support national GHG reporting: develop a valid, measurement-based
inventory of reference SOC stocks for IPCC-Tier 2 assessments;</p></li>
<li><p>Further utilize SOC mapping to estimate the soil carbon
sequestration potentials (e.g. through modeling) and the
vulnerability of soil functions under climate change (with SOC as an
indicator);</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals: by developing
national SDG-15.3.1 Tier 3 data for the sub-indicator of soil
carbon;</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct harmonized assessments at different levels of action: GSP
regional soil partnerships, FAO regional and country offices,
national soil information institutions (GSP Pillar 4 INSII),
national statistics offices (already involved with FAOSTAT), and
GEOSS design principles for global data layers.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Training courses on Digital Soil Mapping</h2>
<p>Considering the request from partners to support them by providing
training on state of the art techniques for SOC mapping, the Secretariat
designed a capacity development programme following an on-the-job
training model. The aim of the GSP capacity development program has been
to introduce recent concepts and techniques of digital soil mapping
(DSM) to soil experts who work at national soil science institutes in
soil mapping related activities. The impact of the trainings should be
reflected on developing and updating national and regional soil
information systems.<br />
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Trainings_map.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">GSP - Capacity Development Programme - Training Locations and
Participated Countries</p>
</div>
<p>In order to support national capacities on digital soil organic carbon
mapping, DSM workshops were organized by the GSP and the regional soil
partnerships. The training workshops were already part of the GSP
capacity development programme before the launch of the GSOCmap project
(2012-2016). In 2017, the training focused more on digital soil organic
carbon mapping to support countries with their GSOCmap contributions.
After the launch of the GSOCmap project, additional training sessions
were organized in different regions and eventually the capacity
development program was able to reach 105 countries and 60% of the area
coverage.<br />
The contents of the workshops included: introduction to R; preparing
spatial covariates using SAGA GIS; correlation analysis;
regression-kriging; randomForest; support vector machines; uncertainties
and validation. By the end of the training courses, participants were
able to collect and rescue soil legacy data, compile and harmonize soil
data for DSM applications, implement DSM, produce soil property maps and
their uncertainties, and develop accurate digital soil maps for updating
their national soil information systems.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Cookbook</h2>
<p>The Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Cookbook <span class="citation">(Yigini et al. 2018)</span> has been developed
by the ITPS and GSP Secretariat to provide generic methodologies and the
technical steps for producing a SOC map. This includes step-by-step
guidance for developing 1 km grids for SOC stocks, as well as for the
preparation of local soil data, the compilation and pre-processing of
ancillary spatial data sets, mapping methodologies, and uncertainty
assessments.<br />
Guidance is mainly specific to soil organic carbon data, but also
contains many generic sections on soil grid development due to its
relevance for other soil properties. The main focus of the guidance is
on the mapping of SOC stocks in the GSOCmap and as such the cookbook
supplements the GSP Guidelines for sharing national data/information to
compile a Global Soil Organic Carbon (GSOC) map. It provides technical
guidance to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Setting up the needed software environment</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing ground data for soil organic carbon modeling</p></li>
<li><p>Calculating SOC stocks from local samples to a target depth of 30
cm;</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing spatial covariates for mapping</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Metadata specifications</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that the national layers metadata would be sufficient

required to share information about their original data according to the
following principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Share auxiliary information about the national data sources,
e.g. type of sampling (soil profile or auger), density of sampling
points in the country, sampling design (distribution and sampling
depth/s), time of sampling (year), selection criteria (if subset of
soil profiles is selected from a larger national database).</p></li>
<li><p>Provide as much metadata as possible in order to estimate the
quality of the global SOC map. For example, SOC method(s) of
analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Share metadata about SOC stocks calculation in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describing how SOC stocks for the target depth 0-30 cm have been
calculated; if there are any deviations from this specification,
provide an explanation.</p></li>
<li><p>Quantifying the amount of carbon stored in litter (organic layer

</ul></li>
<li><p>In order to consider the temporal dimension of the SOC map, it is
important to share the sampling date as metadata. If the national
data situation allows, pre- 1990 or post-1990 sub data sets might be
defined. However, it will be an important asset of this SOC map to
demonstrate the density of existing soil carbon data sets. The more
data points are used, the better the reliability and accuracy of the
global product. Subsequent steps to improve the temporal dimension,
will be considered at a later stage.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Delivery of the maps produced by the countries</h3>
<p>The GSP Secretariat contacted countries about their potential
contributions to the GSOCmap project and informed countries about the
process and the procedure.</p>
<p>Countries already having national SOC maps that meet the specifications
of this project, shared their data with the GSP Secretariat. If a
national SOC map exists, and if not all requirements were met,
adjustments to the existing SOC map were implemented (e.g. recalculation
according to target depth).<br />
Countries which did not yet have a national SOC map, developed such a
map based on the specifications. Where needed, the GSP Secretariat
supported such national activities by organising training sessions.<br />
Upon receiving the national maps, the GSP Secretariat undertook the
preliminary data quality checks. Whenever the national maps were
inconsistent with the GSOC specifications, the GSP Secretariat worked in
close collaboration with the institutions that provided the national
data to resolve the existing issues.<br />
76 countries submitted their maps as a contribution to the GSOCmap. This
represents 65% of the world area (Table
<a href="#tab:source" reference-type="ref" reference="tab:source">5.1</a>).</p>
<div id="data-submission-form" class="section level4" number="5.1.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1.1</span> Data submission form</h4>
<p>To deliver their data, countries were required to use the online data
submission tool. The tool realized a guided delivery process which
required the submitter to upload the map along with a 1-page report, and
to answer questions about the methodology according to the metadata
specifications. The questionnaire can be found in Annex
<a href="#chap:form" reference-type="ref" reference="chap:form">9</a>.<br />
This questionnaire and the report were used to create the
country-specific metadata for the map. A summary of this data can be
found in Annex

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.2</span> Joint efforts</h3>
<p>If the in-country development of a SOC map was not possible due to
insufficient capacity, the original SOC measurements were shared with
the GSP secretariat which would then execute the mapping in close
cooperation with the national GSP-focal points and/or institutional data
providers.<br />
For the mapping, the GSP Secretariat used state-of-the-art digital soil
mapping techniques and publicly available layers of environmental
covariates (ISRIC, ftp service). The data were then evaluated by the
national experts who made the final decision regarding the results of
the joint mapping procedure and the final submission of the map. 8
country maps were prepared with joint efforts between the GSP and the
countries (Table <a href="#tab:source" reference-type="ref" reference="tab:source">5.1</a>).</p>

<p>For the countries that could not provide a SOC map or any original
measurements, the GSP Secretariat used one of the two gap-filling
approaches: spatial modeling using publicly available data or, in the
case of absence or insufficient amount of data, using publicly available
SOC stock maps.<br />
The gap filling procedure involved producing maps for 123 countries. 75
country maps (25.6% of the world area) were done using available data;
and 47 country maps (1.4% of the world area) were filled using external
datasets (e.g. <a href="soilgrids.org" class="uri">soilgrids.org</a> data).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Data processing and compilation of the GSOCmap</h2>
<p>In order to compile a Global Soil Organic Carbon Map from the national
contributions, the GSP Secretariat conducted basic data processing aimed
to standardize the individual layers with minimal or no changes to the
data provided by the countries. The processing steps included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reprojecting data to coordinate system lon/lat WGS84 with spatial
resolution of 30 arc second using ‘nearest neighbour’ method (where
necessary);</p></li>
<li><p>Resampling the data to 30 arcsec grid resolution using bilinear
interpolation (in case the cell size of the original data was
different)</p></li>
<li><p>Converting SOC stock values to tonnes/ha (where necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>Mosaicking individual maps of the countries to acquire the global
layer using ‘nearest neighbour’ method for resampling.</p></li>
<li><p>Filling NoData values at national borderlines (in case the countries
didn’t use suggested empty grids) using GDAL gapfilling algorithm
which interpolates values for all designated NoData pixels using
inverse distance weighting and a four direction conic search to find
values to interpolate from. A mask compiled from a 5-km buffer
around country borders (excluding water bodies and coastlines) was
used as a gap-filling procedure in order to make sure that only
border gaps are filled and the NoData values provided by countries

<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Metadata</h1>
<p>The GSOCmap is a compilation of soil organic carbon stock maps produced

<span class="citation">(FAO - GSP 2017)</span>. The total number of profiles/sampling locations used to
create the global product is: 1 079 617. The number of sampling plots

<div id="sampling-density" class="section level2" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Sampling Density</h2>
<p>The metadata allows to assess the density of sampling points per country
as shown in figure <a href="#fig:density" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:density">6.1</a>. It varies greatly and reflects the differences
in the soil data coverage between countries and regions. This
information can be used as an assessment of the current status of the
available soil information in the world and to identify the regions
where additional sampling is most needed.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Meta1.png" id="fig:density" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Density of point data (per country)</p>

<p>However, aggregation of the data at the country level does not allow to

</div>
<div id="temporal-dimension" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Temporal dimension</h2>
<p>The metadata on the period of sampling was analyzed against the
suggested baseline date 1990. 11% of the countries did not provide
information about the temporal dimension. Besides, data about the
temporal dimension for the 25% of the countries with data from external
datasets, like <a href="soilgrids.org" class="uri">soilgrids.org</a>, were not available.
The other 65% is divided: 15% with data from before 1990; 25% with a mix
of data before and after 1990 and only 25% with all the data surveyed
after 1990.<br />
The results show that most countries had to include observations from
before 1990 to develop a dataset representing all their territory (Fig.
<a href="#fig:sampling" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:sampling">6.2</a>).
This means that the GSOCmap can be used as a baseline for SOC monitoring
only for the countries with all the submitted data originating from
recent soil surveys. However, the GSOCmap can be viewed as a baseline
map, as it contains the best available estimation of SOC at the country
level (see Validation and comparison with existing products), making it
an important tool for identifying SOC deficient areas within the
countries and subsequently for planning the soil-protecting, sampling
and monitoring activities.</p>

<p>Concerning the SOC analysis method, 42% of the countries used wet
oxidation, and 14% used dry combustion. The number of countries using

The metadata shows differences in the methods used throughout the world
for determining SOC (Fig. <a href="#fig:SOC" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:SOC">6.3</a>). This is valuable information for investigating
the possibility of further harmonization of national data. One of the
known issues is the difference in measured carbon values between
Ethiopia and the surrounding countries, which could be caused by the
difference in SOC analysis method since Ethiopia was the only country to
use soil spectroscopy measurements as its primary data source.<br />

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:mapping" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:mapping">6.6</a>
shows that most countries (66%) were able to use the state-of-the-art
digital soil mapping techniques which demonstrates the overall success
of the capacity building program undertaken by the FAO/GSP. Only 7% of
the countries used conventional upscaling.<br />
The heterogeneity of the mapping techniques could be one of the sources
of uncertainty and ‘border effects’ between national products. However,
the map shows that the difference in mapping methods is not the primary
source of border inconsistency. As shown in the Figure
<a href="#fig:mapfrag" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:mapfrag">6.7</a>, in
many cases, the maps produced with different mapping methods have
comparable values and form a continuous surface of organic carbon
distribution with acceptable differences. Besides, there is no best
mapping method for digital soil mapping, and testing and selection has
to be done for every data scenario <span class="citation">(Guevara et al. 2018)</span>.</p>

<p>The primary source of uncertainty and border inconsistencies appears to
be in the original point data quality and representativity. The
difference at the borders between the countries occurs when the adjacent
region is not covered with soil sampling data and the values are
extrapolated using a model from a different area or assigned on the
basis of expert knowledge. Therefore, it is suggested that the work on
improving the global consistency should be primarily focused on
acquiring additional data in the under sampled regions and capacity
development aimed at ensuring that an appropriate mapping method was
used based on the data distribution and representativity.</p>

<p>The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) represents one of
the largest uncertainties in the carbon cycle (Figure
<a href="#fig:comparison" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:comparison">7.3</a>). High resolution gridded data-sets of SOC
are increasingly important for global modeling efforts and validation
strategies <span class="citation">(Jackson et al. 2017)</span>. Validation experiments (e.g. across borders),
the comparison of different approaches to predict soil carbon and the
continuous calibration of country-specific-to- regional-to-global models
are required to provide reliable estimates and enable the monitoring of
SOC stocks.</p>

<p>To compare and test different approaches (e.g. modeling and
geo-matching), to map SOC stocks is relevant to reduce the current
levels of uncertainty regarding the spatial variability and distribution
of SOC, because they will work differently for the same objective. Using
the same dataset, different approaches to map SOC will share bias
derived from the quality of the data and the data characteristics that
allow to meet modeling assumptions, or provide certainty to the soil
mapper delineating a soil carbon polygon unit.<br />
The validation of the map was done by comparison with available soil
profile data and the existing global SOC products. First, a validation
dataset was compiled from international publicly available datasets, in
particular the International Soil Carbon
Network(ISCN)<span class="citation">(International Soil Carbon Network 2014; Boby et al. 2010; J. Bockheim et al. 2010a, 2010b; J. G.

only the profiles with measured SOC and bulk density values were
selected, since these parameters are essential for calculating SOC

<p>Mass preserving spline functions were applied to estimate the carbon
content, bulk density and coarse fragments of a standardized horizon of
0 to 30 cm. Finally, the organic carbon stock was estimated using the
GSIF R package. These values were compared with the values in the
GSOCmap. The same dataset was used to compare validation results with 2
other global recent products of SOC, one derived from the Harmonized
World Soil Database (HWSD), based on soil type polygon units

The three SOC maps were re-sampled from their original resolution to a
1x1km grid and centered on the same spatial extent. This comparison
allows to estimate the accuracy of the GSOCmap in relation to other
global products and to ground measurements. The results of the

<p>The result show that GSOCmap on average has lower error than other
global products. Mean gross error (mean absolute error) for GSOCmap is
around 35 t/ha, while other global products have error more than 40
t/ha. Root mean squared error is significantly higher than mean absolute
error for all products which indicates the presence of a relatively
small number of very high errors, most likely associated with organic
soils. Global modeling approach of SoilGrids results in the highest mean
gross error, while polygon-derived HWSD has higher root mean squared
error. However, GSOCmap shows lowest errors in both case which suggests
that country-driven approach allows to minimize errors at the global
scale. The FAC2 (that takes a value of 1 in a perfect model) indicates
the fraction of preictions within a factor of 2 of the observed value.
The FAC2 shows a better performance of the GSOCmap. Another important
observation is that GSOCmap is almost unbiased (mean bias -0.39 t/ha)
while HWSD and especially SoilGrids have significant positive bias
(12.21 t/ha and 31.12 t/ha respectively).<br />
To asses the overall quality of the model, Index of Agreement based on
<span class="citation">(Willmott, Robeson, and Matsuura 2012)</span> was applied to all three global products. This index
between -1 and +1 with values approaching +1 representing better model
performance. GSOCmap showed the highest IOA performance among the three
analyzed products with the score 0.5, which indicates that the sum of
the error-magnitudes is one half of the sum of the observed-deviation
magnitudes.<br />
These results show that the GSOCmap country-driven approach allows to
use much more data locally which helps to minimize errors and ensure
better representativity of the map. However, since the publicly
available datasets mostly cover North and South America and have large
gaps in African and Eurasia, the validation dataset may be biased.
Therefore, GSP started collecting national datasets that were not used
for the development of the GSOCmap, for validation.<br />
For the global comparisons, the analysis based on numerical confusion
matrices derived at the pixel level on SAGA GIS <span class="citation">(Conrad et al. 2015)</span>. A
confusion matrix is a specific table layout that allows visualization of
the main changes from a reference map (initial state) to another (final
state). Thus, it quantifies the absolute difference and the direction of
change comparing the GSOCmap with the HWSD, the GSOCmap with SoilGrids
and the HWSD with SoilGrids. A map of (positive and negative) changes is
derived for each iteration (between the reference and the final state),
where values close to 0 represent areas of high agreement between the
two compared products.</p>

<p class="caption">Change vector maps. Derived from a standardized confusion matrix, the
map in A shows the changes from the GSOCmap to the HWSD, the map in B
shows the changes from the GSOCmap to SoilGrids and the map in C we show
the change from HWSD to SoilGrids.</p>
</div>
<p>It was found that there is a larger agreement between the GSOCmap and
the HWSD than between the GSOCmap and the SoilGrids (Fig.
<a href="#fig:change3maps" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:change3maps">7.5</a>A). While positive and negative changes from
the GSOCmap the HWSD are irregularly distributed, the changes from the
GSOCmap to the SoilGrids products tend to be positive, suggesting a
major carbon pool predicted by the machine learning approach (Fig.
<a href="#fig:change3maps" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:change3maps">7.5</a>B). A similar pattern was found by analyzing
the changes from the HWSD to the SoilGrids map (Fig.
<a href="#fig:change3maps" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:change3maps">7.5</a>C).<br />
These results are useful to identify and quantify differences among
products that can be used to inform the development of future versions
of country-specific and global SOC mapping efforts.</p>

<div id="uncertainty-analysis" class="section level3" number="7.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> Uncertainty analysis</h3>
<p>Uncertainty analysis aims at quantifying possible deviations of SOC
stock estimation on the maps from the real values. SOC map uncertainties
come from the soil sampling, measurements of soil properties, and
mapping techniques.<br />
Although the GSP Secretariat asked the countries to provide information
about the uncertainty of their contributed maps, not many countries were
able to provide it. Besides, the layers contributed from the countries
which could deliver, were generated using different and not comparable
methodologies. The different methodologies used included: confidence
intervals for the SOC values; standard deviation from regression
kriging; standard deviation from an ensemble of different DSM models,
and uncertainties as percentage based on expert knowledge. Therefore, a
global approach for estimating uncertainties was required.<br />
The uncertainty of the map was estimated by spatial comparison with all
available SOC data. For this purpose, several available global, regional
and national soil databases were merged, including WoSIS Soil Profile
Database <span class="citation">(Batjes et al. 2017)</span>, LUCAS Soil Database <span class="citation">(Toth, Jones, and Montanarella 2013)</span>, Soil
Information System for Latin American and the Caribbean (SISLAC)
<span class="citation">(Alianza Mundial por el Suelo 2013)</span>, Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database <span class="citation">(Hugelius et al. 2013)</span>, as
well as national datasets provided by participating countries. This
database of 276,028 points was used to calculate the residuals of the
maps. The residuals were estimated as the difference between the
measured and predicted values and expressed in % of the predicted values
by the GSOCmap. The current map presented in Fig. 6.3 is the result of
the interpolation using ordinary kriging of the residuals. The map shows
standard deviations in tonnes/ha.<br />
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Uncert_GF.png" id="fig:sd" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Map of standard deviations</p>
</div>
<p>The current assessment shows highest uncertainty values in the tropical
desert and arctic desert areas, due to insufficient number of soil
samples from these regions. The difference in uncertainties between the
countries in non-desert areas is mainly associated with the density of
soil sampling and with the choice of mapping techniques. Based on the
map, the uncertainty of global SOC pool value is estimated as +-144 Pg
or around 20%.</p>
<p>The uncertainty layers provided by 22 countries (Argentina, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, France,
Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands,
Nicaragua, Panama, Russia, Venezuela, Viet Nam) can be requested from
the data listed providers in Appedix A.<br />
The global uncertainty assessment will be improved after improving the
global validation dataset and receiving additional uncertainty maps
delivered by the countries.<br />

<h1><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Conclusions and the way forward</h1>
<p>The GSOCmap is a product of global efforts made to bring together the
existing knowledge about soil organic carbon from all over the world.
The map is currently based on more than 1 million profiles, most of the
area is covered by original maps produced by the countries. This ensures
that the GSOCmap is a global product which is consistent with the
national soil knowledge and gives the best available estimation of SOC
stocks at the country level.<br />
The known issues are the differences at the borders between certain
countries and overestimation of SOC stocks for the countries where
external datasets were used for gap filling. These issues will be
gradually addressed as more data is collected by countries which will
allow to improve national maps and replace gap filling with original
data.<br />
The GSOCmap is to be continuously improved as the countries gather more
data to improve their maps. The versioning system is being implemented
which implies publishing the latest version of the map and keeping all
previous versions available upon request.<br />
</p>
<div id="versioning-system" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Versioning system</h2>
<p>The GSOCmap is a living product and will be updated as soon as more and
better information is available. The GSP uses semantic versioning at
certain level so that there is a standard pattern to data releases.
Semantic versioning is widely used in the software development world and
helps developers having a standardized way of versioning software
releases. It follows the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.<br />
The product released on World Soil Day 2017,(5 December) as V1.0.0 and
was soon updated to V1.2.0 with minor updates. In June 2019 the map was
updated to V1.5.0 with new and updated national contributions, as well
as improved gap-filling. Change-log is also to be released along with
the data with each public release. The current changelog is persented in
Annex <a href="#chap:changelog" reference-type="ref" reference="chap:changelog">10</a>. The future releases will be using the
following logic:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Major</dt>
<dd><p>Major version will be incremented with substantial updates.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Minor</dt>
<dd><p>Minor version will be incremented with new country submissions,

<h1><span class="header-section-number">12</span> Foreword</h1>
<p>This document presents the technical details of the first ever
country-driven global soil organic carbon map (GSOCmap). This map allows
the estimation of SOC stock from 0 to 30 cm. It represents a key
contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1,
which defines the area of degraded land. The novelty of this map is the
fact that it is the first ever global soil organic carbon assessment
which is produced through a participatory approach. Countries developed
their capacities and stepped up efforts to compile or collect all
available soil information at the national level.<br />
The 5th GSP Plenary Assembly, in June 2017, approved the decision of
member countries jointly developing a GSOCmap as a baseline for the
amount and distribution of SOC soils. This map is part of the process of
building a Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) under the 4th pillar
of the GSP, which aims to enhance the quantity and quality of soil data
and information. This considerable effort, which led to the launch of
the GSOCmap on World Soil Day 2017 (5 December), is paving the way to
the establishment of national soil information systems and represents
the first step toward introducing a soil monitoring program.<br />
This technical report is aimed at scientists. It provides guidance on
the process that led to the establishment of the GSOCmap and on how to
use it. The map provides users with useful information to monitor the
soil condition, identify degraded areas, set restoration targets,
explore SOC sequestration potentials, support the greenhouse gas
emission reporting under the UNFCCC. It also provides users with crucial
information that is needed to make evidence based decisions to mitigate
and adapt to climate change.<br />
We can expect that the extensive data content of more than 1 million
sampling points resulting from country contributions and the interactive
nature of the GSOCmap will greatly assist in the process of building a
global soil information system, which in turn will help contribute in
the achievement of the sustainable development goals.<br />
We are proud to make this very first edition of the global soil organic
carbon map technical summary available for the international scientific
community, and we hope that this map will be a major step in combating
not only climate change which is directly linked to soil organic carbon,
but also poverty, hunger and malnutrition.<br />
The contributing institutions from the participating countries which
submitted their maps or data are listed in Appendix
<a href="#chap:countries" reference-type="ref" reference="chap:countries"><span class="math display">\[chap:countries\]</span></a>.<br />
This technical report is a companion report to the GSOCmap V1.5.0. It
presents methodologies and process of compiling the Global Soil organic
Carbon Map.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> The importance of soil organic carbon</h2>
<p>Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the main component of soil organic matter
(SOM) and is a crucial contributor to food production, mitigation and
adaption to climate change, and the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). SOC affects most of the processes relevant to
soil functions and food production. A high SOM, and therefore SOC
content provides plants with the nutrients and water they need by
increasing soil fertility and water availability, which in turn improve
food productivity. SOC has also long been used as an indicator of soil
health, due to its capacity to improve soil structural stability, which
affects porosity, aeration and water filtration capacities to supply
clean water. However, SOC mineralization can be an important source of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This means that changing SOM (and hence
SOC) not only changes the provision of ecosystem services required for
crop production, but also affects soils’ capacity to buffer against
environmental changes, as it regulates the resilience agricultural
systems to climate change.<br />
SOC has received great attention during the development of the
greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting programme of the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) since the mid-nineties. This was done to
address the contribution of intensive land management and the vast
amount of degraded land to greenhouse gas emissions, since these have
caused tremendous historic losses of SOC, resulting in high potentials
for future carbon storage. Recently, an increasing number of authors
have stressed the crucial role of healthy soils, with soil carbon being
the most important indicator for food security and resilience against
climate change. This has led to above and below ground carbon (SOC)
becoming sub-indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
target 15.3.1 (Proportion of land that is degraded over total land
area).<br />
The Status of the World’s Soil Resources (SWRS) report highlights that,
although more carbon is stored in the soil than in the atmosphere and
plant life combined, a large portion (33%) of the world’s soils are
degraded, which has led to a major loss of global SOC reserves. The
reversal of soil degradation through the buildup of SOM and the
sustainable management of soils therefore offers large potential to
contribute to climate change mitigation by sequestering atmospheric
carbon into the soil. This emphasizes that soil can be a double-edged
sword when it comes to carbon fluxes, as it can either be a net sink or
a net source of GHGs depending on soil management practices.<br />
Despite the current focus on SOC, knowledge about SOC baselines and
changes, and the detection of vulnerable hot spots for SOC losses and
gains under climate change and changed land management are still fairly
limited. Accurate SOC baselines are still needed for many countries, and
estimates about the role of soils in the global carbon cycle are
currently only based on rough estimates, which results in large
uncertainties. Global SOC estimates exist, but there is high variability
in reported values among authors, caused by the diversity of different
data sources and methodologies used to calculate and measure these
estimates <span class="citation">(Henry, Valentini, and Bernoux 2009; Köchy, Hiederer, and Freibauer 2015)</span>.<br />

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.2</span> Objectives of soil carbon mapping</h2>
<p>The Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils (ITPS) and the GSP
Secretariat were asked by the Science-Policy Interface (SPI) of the
United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to share
information about the possible pathways to support the SDG 15.3.1
indicator on SOC. During the 5th Session of the ITPS held during March
2016, collaboration between the ITPS and the SPI of the UNCCD, the
Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services
(IPBES), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was
discussed. The GSP/ITPS were requested to conduct a global SOC
assessment based on country-level spatial soil data sets, combined into
a new global SOC map. This task would directly relate to SDG 15.3.1, and
would also support the endorsed metrics for the assessment of land
degradation neutrality (LDN) <span class="citation">(FAO and GSP 2016b)</span>. The preparation of the
GSOCmap was discussed and supported to the 4th and 5th GSP Plenary
Assembly <span class="citation">(FAO and GSP 2016a, 2017a)</span>.<br />
As it was approved by the decision of the 5th GSP Plenary Assembly, June
2017 <span class="citation">(FAO and GSP 2017a)</span>, GSP members agreed to jointly develop a global SOC map as
the zero status for the amount and distribution of SOC in soils around
the world. This map was developed following the general GSP principle of
being a country-driven initiative. It is a part of the process to build
a Global Soil Information System under GSP Pillar 4 (Enhance the
quantity and quality of soil data and information: data collection
(generation), analysis, validation, reporting, monitoring and
integration with other disciplines).<br />
The development of a global soil organic carbon map using a
country-driven approach provides and builds on synergies with ongoing
and new reporting needs, data sharing obligations, and therefore
benefits activities at national, regional and global levels.
Particularly to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable training for countries in need of technical support
(e.g. regarding the collection, statistical evaluation and modeling
of SOC data);</p></li>
<li><p>Develop data infrastructure to update the SWRS report on SOC through
a country-driven baseline, and initiate future assessments of SOC
changes;</p></li>
<li><p>Support national GHG reporting: develop a valid, measurement-based
inventory of reference SOC stocks for IPCC-Tier 2 assessments;</p></li>
<li><p>Further utilize SOC mapping to estimate the soil carbon
sequestration potentials (e.g. through modeling) and the
vulnerability of soil functions under climate change (with SOC as an
indicator);</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals: by developing
national SDG-15.3.1 Tier 3 data for the sub-indicator of soil
carbon;</p></li>
<li><p>Conduct harmonized assessments at different levels of action: GSP
regional soil partnerships, FAO regional and country offices,
national soil information institutions (GSP Pillar 4 INSII),
national statistics offices (already involved with FAOSTAT), and
GEOSS design principles for global data layers.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.1</span> Training courses on Digital Soil Mapping</h2>
<p>Considering the request from partners to support them by providing
training on state of the art techniques for SOC mapping, the Secretariat
designed a capacity development programme following an on-the-job
training model. The aim of the GSP capacity development program has been
to introduce recent concepts and techniques of digital soil mapping
(DSM) to soil experts who work at national soil science institutes in
soil mapping related activities. The impact of the trainings should be
reflected on developing and updating national and regional soil
information systems.<br />
</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">GSP - Capacity Development Programme - Training Locations and
Participated Countries</p>
</div>
<p>In order to support national capacities on digital soil organic carbon
mapping, DSM workshops were organized by the GSP and the regional soil
partnerships. The training workshops were already part of the GSP
capacity development programme before the launch of the GSOCmap project
(2012-2016). In 2017, the training focused more on digital soil organic
carbon mapping to support countries with their GSOCmap contributions.
After the launch of the GSOCmap project, additional training sessions
were organized in different regions and eventually the capacity
development program was able to reach 105 countries and 60% of the area
coverage.<br />
The contents of the workshops included: introduction to R; preparing
spatial covariates using SAGA GIS; correlation analysis;
regression-kriging; randomForest; support vector machines; uncertainties
and validation. By the end of the training courses, participants were
able to collect and rescue soil legacy data, compile and harmonize soil
data for DSM applications, implement DSM, produce soil property maps and
their uncertainties, and develop accurate digital soil maps for updating
their national soil information systems.<br />

<p>A systematic process was by the GSP Secretariat to assist and provide

<h2><span class="header-section-number">14.3</span> Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Cookbook</h2>
<p>The Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Cookbook <span class="citation">(Yigini et al. 2018)</span> has been developed
by the ITPS and GSP Secretariat to provide generic methodologies and the
technical steps for producing a SOC map. This includes step-by-step
guidance for developing 1 km grids for SOC stocks, as well as for the
preparation of local soil data, the compilation and pre-processing of
ancillary spatial data sets, mapping methodologies, and uncertainty
assessments.<br />
Guidance is mainly specific to soil organic carbon data, but also
contains many generic sections on soil grid development due to its
relevance for other soil properties. The main focus of the guidance is
on the mapping of SOC stocks in the GSOCmap and as such the cookbook
supplements the GSP Guidelines for sharing national data/information to
compile a Global Soil Organic Carbon (GSOC) map. It provides technical
guidance to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Setting up the needed software environment</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing ground data for soil organic carbon modeling</p></li>
<li><p>Calculating SOC stocks from local samples to a target depth of 30
cm;</p></li>
<li><p>Preparing spatial covariates for mapping</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing and applying the best suitable mapping methodology.</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluating the results and the outputs and providing guidance on
validation and uncertainty assessments.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.1.1</span> Delivery of the maps produced by the countries</h3>
<p>The GSP Secretariat contacted countries about their potential
contributions to the GSOCmap project and informed countries about the
process and the procedure.</p>
<p>Countries already having national SOC maps that meet the specifications
of this project, shared their data with the GSP Secretariat. If a
national SOC map exists, and if not all requirements were met,
adjustments to the existing SOC map were implemented (e.g. recalculation
according to target depth).<br />
Countries which did not yet have a national SOC map, developed such a
map based on the specifications. Where needed, the GSP Secretariat
supported such national activities by organising training sessions.<br />
Upon receiving the national maps, the GSP Secretariat undertook the
preliminary data quality checks. Whenever the national maps were
inconsistent with the GSOC specifications, the GSP Secretariat worked in
close collaboration with the institutions that provided the national
data to resolve the existing issues.<br />
76 countries submitted their maps as a contribution to the GSOCmap. This
represents 65% of the world area (Table
<a href="#tab:source" reference-type="ref" reference="tab:source">5.1</a>).</p>
<div id="data-submission-form-1" class="section level4" number="16.1.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">16.1.1.1</span> Data submission form</h4>
<p>To deliver their data, countries were required to use the online data
submission tool. The tool realized a guided delivery process which
required the submitter to upload the map along with a 1-page report, and
to answer questions about the methodology according to the metadata
specifications. The questionnaire can be found in Annex
<a href="#chap:form" reference-type="ref" reference="chap:form">9</a>.<br />
This questionnaire and the report were used to create the
country-specific metadata for the map. A summary of this data can be
found in Annex

<h3><span class="header-section-number">16.1.2</span> Joint efforts</h3>
<p>If the in-country development of a SOC map was not possible due to
insufficient capacity, the original SOC measurements were shared with
the GSP secretariat which would then execute the mapping in close
cooperation with the national GSP-focal points and/or institutional data
providers.<br />
For the mapping, the GSP Secretariat used state-of-the-art digital soil
mapping techniques and publicly available layers of environmental
covariates (ISRIC, ftp service). The data were then evaluated by the
national experts who made the final decision regarding the results of
the joint mapping procedure and the final submission of the map. 8
country maps were prepared with joint efforts between the GSP and the
countries (Table <a href="#tab:source" reference-type="ref" reference="tab:source">5.1</a>).</p>

measurements, the GSP Secretariat used one of the two gap-filling
approaches: spatial modeling using publicly available data or, in the
case of absence or insufficient amount of data, using publicly available
SOC stock maps.<br />
The gap filling procedure involved producing maps for 123 countries. 75
country maps (25.6% of the world area) were done using available data;
and 47 country maps (1.4% of the world area) were filled using external
datasets (e.g. <a href="soilgrids.org" class="uri">soilgrids.org</a> data).</p>

<p>In order to compile a Global Soil Organic Carbon Map from the national
contributions, the GSP Secretariat conducted basic data processing aimed
to standardize the individual layers with minimal or no changes to the
data provided by the countries. The processing steps included:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reprojecting data to coordinate system lon/lat WGS84 with spatial
resolution of 30 arc second using ‘nearest neighbour’ method (where
necessary);</p></li>
<li><p>Resampling the data to 30 arcsec grid resolution using bilinear
interpolation (in case the cell size of the original data was
different)</p></li>
<li><p>Converting SOC stock values to tonnes/ha (where necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>Mosaicking individual maps of the countries to acquire the global
layer using ‘nearest neighbour’ method for resampling.</p></li>
<li><p>Filling NoData values at national borderlines (in case the countries
didn’t use suggested empty grids) using GDAL gapfilling algorithm
which interpolates values for all designated NoData pixels using
inverse distance weighting and a four direction conic search to find
values to interpolate from. A mask compiled from a 5-km buffer
around country borders (excluding water bodies and coastlines) was
used as a gap-filling procedure in order to make sure that only
border gaps are filled and the NoData values provided by countries

<p>The GSOCmap is a compilation of soil organic carbon stock maps produced

<span class="citation">(FAO - GSP 2017)</span>. The total number of profiles/sampling locations used to
create the global product is: 1 079 617. The number of sampling plots

<div id="sampling-density-1" class="section level2" number="17.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.1</span> Sampling Density</h2>
<p>The metadata allows to assess the density of sampling points per country
as shown in figure <a href="#fig:density" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:density">6.1</a>. It varies greatly and reflects the differences
in the soil data coverage between countries and regions. This
information can be used as an assessment of the current status of the
available soil information in the world and to identify the regions
where additional sampling is most needed.</p>
<div class="figure">

<div id="temporal-dimension-1" class="section level2" number="17.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.2</span> Temporal dimension</h2>
<p>The metadata on the period of sampling was analyzed against the
suggested baseline date 1990. 11% of the countries did not provide
information about the temporal dimension. Besides, data about the
temporal dimension for the 25% of the countries with data from external
datasets, like <a href="soilgrids.org" class="uri">soilgrids.org</a>, were not available.
The other 65% is divided: 15% with data from before 1990; 25% with a mix
of data before and after 1990 and only 25% with all the data surveyed
after 1990.<br />
The results show that most countries had to include observations from
before 1990 to develop a dataset representing all their territory (Fig.
<a href="#fig:sampling" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:sampling">6.2</a>).
This means that the GSOCmap can be used as a baseline for SOC monitoring
only for the countries with all the submitted data originating from
recent soil surveys. However, the GSOCmap can be viewed as a baseline
map, as it contains the best available estimation of SOC at the country
level (see Validation and comparison with existing products), making it
an important tool for identifying SOC deficient areas within the
countries and subsequently for planning the soil-protecting, sampling
and monitoring activities.</p>

<p>Concerning the SOC analysis method, 42% of the countries used wet

The metadata shows differences in the methods used throughout the world
for determining SOC (Fig. <a href="#fig:SOC" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:SOC">6.3</a>). This is valuable information for investigating
the possibility of further harmonization of national data. One of the
known issues is the difference in measured carbon values between
Ethiopia and the surrounding countries, which could be caused by the
difference in SOC analysis method since Ethiopia was the only country to
use soil spectroscopy measurements as its primary data source.<br />

the countries used conventional upscaling.<br />
The heterogeneity of the mapping techniques could be one of the sources
of uncertainty and ‘border effects’ between national products. However,
the map shows that the difference in mapping methods is not the primary
source of border inconsistency. As shown in the Figure
<a href="#fig:mapfrag" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:mapfrag">6.7</a>, in
many cases, the maps produced with different mapping methods have
comparable values and form a continuous surface of organic carbon
distribution with acceptable differences. Besides, there is no best
mapping method for digital soil mapping, and testing and selection has
to be done for every data scenario <span class="citation">(Guevara et al. 2018)</span>.</p>

<p class="caption">Fragment of the GSOCmap with different techniques used for mapping at

<p>The primary source of uncertainty and border inconsistencies appears to
be in the original point data quality and representativity. The
difference at the borders between the countries occurs when the adjacent
region is not covered with soil sampling data and the values are
extrapolated using a model from a different area or assigned on the
basis of expert knowledge. Therefore, it is suggested that the work on
improving the global consistency should be primarily focused on
acquiring additional data in the under sampled regions and capacity
development aimed at ensuring that an appropriate mapping method was
used based on the data distribution and representativity.</p>

was spatially intersected with the IPCC, 2006 climate regions layer. The
zones are defined by a set of rules based on annual mean daily
temperature, total annual precipitation, total annual Potential

located in the boreal moist zone followed by the Cool Temperate Moist
zone (Table <a href="#tab:stocksclimate" reference-type="ref" reference="tab:stocksclimate">7.1</a>). To show the relation between below

<p>The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) represents one of
the largest uncertainties in the carbon cycle (Figure
<a href="#fig:comparison" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:comparison">7.3</a>). High resolution gridded data-sets of SOC
are increasingly important for global modeling efforts and validation
strategies <span class="citation">(Jackson et al. 2017)</span>. Validation experiments (e.g. across borders),
the comparison of different approaches to predict soil carbon and the
continuous calibration of country-specific-to- regional-to-global models
are required to provide reliable estimates and enable the monitoring of
SOC stocks.</p>

</div>
<p>To compare and test different approaches (e.g. modeling and
geo-matching), to map SOC stocks is relevant to reduce the current
levels of uncertainty regarding the spatial variability and distribution
of SOC, because they will work differently for the same objective. Using
the same dataset, different approaches to map SOC will share bias
derived from the quality of the data and the data characteristics that
allow to meet modeling assumptions, or provide certainty to the soil
mapper delineating a soil carbon polygon unit.<br />
The validation of the map was done by comparison with available soil
profile data and the existing global SOC products. First, a validation
dataset was compiled from international publicly available datasets, in
particular the International Soil Carbon
Network(ISCN)<span class="citation">(International Soil Carbon Network 2014; Boby et al. 2010; J. Bockheim et al. 2010a, 2010b; J. G.

only the profiles with measured SOC and bulk density values were
selected, since these parameters are essential for calculating SOC
stocks - 50708 points in total (Figure

SOC stock calculations, where available.<br />

<p>Mass preserving spline functions were applied to estimate the carbon
content, bulk density and coarse fragments of a standardized horizon of
0 to 30 cm. Finally, the organic carbon stock was estimated using the
GSIF R package. These values were compared with the values in the
GSOCmap. The same dataset was used to compare validation results with 2
other global recent products of SOC, one derived from the Harmonized
World Soil Database (HWSD), based on soil type polygon units

based on machine learning and environmental correlation <span class="citation">(Hengl et al. 2017)</span>.
The three SOC maps were re-sampled from their original resolution to a
1x1km grid and centered on the same spatial extent. This comparison
allows to estimate the accuracy of the GSOCmap in relation to other
global products and to ground measurements. The results of the
validation analysis are shown in table (Table

<p>The result show that GSOCmap on average has lower error than other
global products. Mean gross error (mean absolute error) for GSOCmap is
around 35 t/ha, while other global products have error more than 40
t/ha. Root mean squared error is significantly higher than mean absolute
error for all products which indicates the presence of a relatively
small number of very high errors, most likely associated with organic
soils. Global modeling approach of SoilGrids results in the highest mean
gross error, while polygon-derived HWSD has higher root mean squared
error. However, GSOCmap shows lowest errors in both case which suggests
that country-driven approach allows to minimize errors at the global
scale. The FAC2 (that takes a value of 1 in a perfect model) indicates
the fraction of preictions within a factor of 2 of the observed value.
The FAC2 shows a better performance of the GSOCmap. Another important
observation is that GSOCmap is almost unbiased (mean bias -0.39 t/ha)
while HWSD and especially SoilGrids have significant positive bias
(12.21 t/ha and 31.12 t/ha respectively).<br />
To asses the overall quality of the model, Index of Agreement based on
<span class="citation">(Willmott, Robeson, and Matsuura 2012)</span> was applied to all three global products. This index
between -1 and +1 with values approaching +1 representing better model
performance. GSOCmap showed the highest IOA performance among the three
analyzed products with the score 0.5, which indicates that the sum of
the error-magnitudes is one half of the sum of the observed-deviation
magnitudes.<br />
These results show that the GSOCmap country-driven approach allows to
use much more data locally which helps to minimize errors and ensure
better representativity of the map. However, since the publicly
available datasets mostly cover North and South America and have large
gaps in African and Eurasia, the validation dataset may be biased.
Therefore, GSP started collecting national datasets that were not used
for the development of the GSOCmap, for validation.<br />
For the global comparisons, the analysis based on numerical confusion
matrices derived at the pixel level on SAGA GIS <span class="citation">(Conrad et al. 2015)</span>. A
confusion matrix is a specific table layout that allows visualization of
the main changes from a reference map (initial state) to another (final
state). Thus, it quantifies the absolute difference and the direction of
change comparing the GSOCmap with the HWSD, the GSOCmap with SoilGrids
and the HWSD with SoilGrids. A map of (positive and negative) changes is
derived for each iteration (between the reference and the final state),
where values close to 0 represent areas of high agreement between the
two compared products.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Change vector maps. Derived from a standardized confusion matrix, the
map in A shows the changes from the GSOCmap to the HWSD, the map in B

</div>
<p>It was found that there is a larger agreement between the GSOCmap and
the HWSD than between the GSOCmap and the SoilGrids (Fig.
<a href="#fig:change3maps" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:change3maps">7.5</a>A). While positive and negative changes from
the GSOCmap the HWSD are irregularly distributed, the changes from the
GSOCmap to the SoilGrids products tend to be positive, suggesting a
major carbon pool predicted by the machine learning approach (Fig.
<a href="#fig:change3maps" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:change3maps">7.5</a>B). A similar pattern was found by analyzing
the changes from the HWSD to the SoilGrids map (Fig.
<a href="#fig:change3maps" reference-type="ref" reference="fig:change3maps">7.5</a>C).<br />
These results are useful to identify and quantify differences among
products that can be used to inform the development of future versions
of country-specific and global SOC mapping efforts.</p>

<div id="uncertainty-analysis-1" class="section level3" number="18.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">18.2.2</span> Uncertainty analysis</h3>
<p>Uncertainty analysis aims at quantifying possible deviations of SOC
stock estimation on the maps from the real values. SOC map uncertainties
come from the soil sampling, measurements of soil properties, and
mapping techniques.<br />
Although the GSP Secretariat asked the countries to provide information
about the uncertainty of their contributed maps, not many countries were
able to provide it. Besides, the layers contributed from the countries
which could deliver, were generated using different and not comparable
methodologies. The different methodologies used included: confidence
intervals for the SOC values; standard deviation from regression
kriging; standard deviation from an ensemble of different DSM models,
and uncertainties as percentage based on expert knowledge. Therefore, a
global approach for estimating uncertainties was required.<br />
The uncertainty of the map was estimated by spatial comparison with all
available SOC data. For this purpose, several available global, regional
and national soil databases were merged, including WoSIS Soil Profile
Database <span class="citation">(Batjes et al. 2017)</span>, LUCAS Soil Database <span class="citation">(Toth, Jones, and Montanarella 2013)</span>, Soil
Information System for Latin American and the Caribbean (SISLAC)
<span class="citation">(Alianza Mundial por el Suelo 2013)</span>, Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database <span class="citation">(Hugelius et al. 2013)</span>, as
well as national datasets provided by participating countries. This
database of 276,028 points was used to calculate the residuals of the
maps. The residuals were estimated as the difference between the
measured and predicted values and expressed in % of the predicted values
by the GSOCmap. The current map presented in Fig. 6.3 is the result of
the interpolation using ordinary kriging of the residuals. The map shows
standard deviations in tonnes/ha.<br />
</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/Uncert_GF.png" id="fig:sd" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Map of standard deviations</p>
</div>
<p>The current assessment shows highest uncertainty values in the tropical
desert and arctic desert areas, due to insufficient number of soil
samples from these regions. The difference in uncertainties between the
countries in non-desert areas is mainly associated with the density of
soil sampling and with the choice of mapping techniques. Based on the
map, the uncertainty of global SOC pool value is estimated as +-144 Pg
or around 20%.</p>
<p>The uncertainty layers provided by 22 countries (Argentina, Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, France,
Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands,
Nicaragua, Panama, Russia, Venezuela, Viet Nam) can be requested from
the data listed providers in Appedix A.<br />
The global uncertainty assessment will be improved after improving the
global validation dataset and receiving additional uncertainty maps
delivered by the countries.<br />

<h1><span class="header-section-number">19</span> Conclusions and the way forward</h1>
<p>The GSOCmap is a product of global efforts made to bring together the
existing knowledge about soil organic carbon from all over the world.
The map is currently based on more than 1 million profiles, most of the
area is covered by original maps produced by the countries. This ensures
that the GSOCmap is a global product which is consistent with the
national soil knowledge and gives the best available estimation of SOC
stocks at the country level.<br />
The known issues are the differences at the borders between certain
countries and overestimation of SOC stocks for the countries where
external datasets were used for gap filling. These issues will be
gradually addressed as more data is collected by countries which will
allow to improve national maps and replace gap filling with original
data.<br />
The GSOCmap is to be continuously improved as the countries gather more
data to improve their maps. The versioning system is being implemented
which implies publishing the latest version of the map and keeping all
previous versions available upon request.<br />
</p>
<div id="versioning-system-1" class="section level2" number="19.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">19.1</span> Versioning system</h2>
<p>The GSOCmap is a living product and will be updated as soon as more and
better information is available. The GSP uses semantic versioning at
certain level so that there is a standard pattern to data releases.
Semantic versioning is widely used in the software development world and
helps developers having a standardized way of versioning software
releases. It follows the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.<br />

was soon updated to V1.2.0 with minor updates. In June 2019 the map was
updated to V1.5.0 with new and updated national contributions, as well
as improved gap-filling. Change-log is also to be released along with
the data with each public release. The current changelog is persented in
Annex <a href="#chap:changelog" reference-type="ref" reference="chap:changelog">10</a>. The future releases will be using the
following logic:</p>
