\section{Background and objectives}\label{background-and-objectives}}

To date, a total number of around 2.3 billion people are affected by moderate and severe food insecurity (FAO et al., 2022). In 2020, within the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, an additional 320 million people became affected by food insecurity (FAO et al., 2021). The current conflicts and aggravating climate change further jeopardise achieving sustainable development goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030. The situation is alarming and urgent action is needed to revert the trends and increase food security.

The current global situation requires an increase of food production while preserving natural (soil) resources, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and optimising the use of goods such as fertilisers on agricultural sites (Eisenstein, 2020). Fertiliser prices more than doubled within one year and grain prices increased by around 25 percent (Jan.~2021 - Jan.~2022) (Hebebrand and Laborde, 2022). With the start of the armed conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, this trend became more pronounced.

Growing food insecurity and rapidly increasing fertiliser prices underscore the urgent need for informed decision-making and optimised soil nutrient management. However, a large data gap exists in regards to soil nutrient stocks and soil properties that govern nutrient availability. Therefore, FAO's Global Soil Partnership (GSP) has launched the Global Soil Nutrient and Nutrient Budget map (GSNmap) initiative in an endeavour to provide harmonised and finely resolved soil nutrient data and information to stakeholders following a country-driven approach.

Up-to-date soil data on the status and spatial trends of soil nutrients and related soil attributes is key to guide policy-making to close yield gaps, and protect local natural resources. Therefore, locally-specific optimisation of soil nutrient and agricultural management are needed (Cunningham et al., 2013). The soil information collected in the GSNmap thereby serves as a cornerstone in delineating priority areas for action and thereby seizes the opportunity to reduce food insecurity, close yield gaps, and reduce environmental costs arising from mismanagement of soil nutrients and especially overfertilisation.

\hypertarget{global-soil-partnership}{%
\section{Global Soil Partnership}\label{global-soil-partnership}}

The Global Soil Partnership (GSP) was established in December 2012 as a mechanism to develop a strong interactive partnership and to enhance collaboration and generate synergies between all stakeholders to raise awareness and protect the world's soil resources. From land users to policymakers, one of the main objectives of GSP is to improve governance and promote sustainable management of soils. Since its creation, GSP has become an important partnership platform where global soil issues are discussed and addressed by multiple stakeholders at different levels.

The mandate of GSP is to improve governance of the planet's limited soil resources in order to guarantee productive agricultural soils for a food-secure world. In addition, it supports other essential soil ecosystem services in accordance with the sovereign right of each Member State over its natural resources. In order to achieve its mandate, GSP addresses six thematic action areas to be implemented in collaboration with its regional soil partnerships (Figure 1).

The area of work on Soil Information and Data (SID) of the GSP builds an enduring and authoritative global system (GloSIS) to monitor and forecast the condition of the Earth's soil resources and produce map products at the global level. The secretariat is working with the international network of soil data providers (INSII - International Network of Soil Information Institutions) to implement data related activities.

\hypertarget{country-driven-approach-and-tasks}{%
\section{Country-driven approach and tasks}\label{country-driven-approach-and-tasks}}

The GSNmap initiative will be jointly implemented by the International Network of Soil Information Institutions (INSII) and the GSP Secretariat. The process will be country-driven, involving and supporting all Member States in developing their national GSNmap data products. The GSNmap products will be developed following a two phase approach:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Phase I: development of soil nutrient and associated soil property maps;
\item
  Phase II: quantification, analysis, projections of nutrient budgets for agricultural land use systems at national, regional and global scale.
\end{itemize}

These guidelines only concern GSNmap Phase I, while the guidelines for the GSNmap Phase II will be published in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Depending on national data availability and technical capacities, ad-hoc solutions will be developed by the GSNmap WG to support countries during the national GSNmap production and/or harmonisation phase. Where possible, GSP Secretariat will use publicly available data to gap-fill the areas which are not covered by the national submissions unless the country requests to be left blank on the GSNmap products.

To be able to interact with the GEE via Python, it is necessary to install certain R packages but also the so-called ``Miniconda'' commmand prompt which acts as Python interpreter mediating between R and GEE. The `ee\_install()' function automatically downloads and install all the software that is needed.

\chapter{Introduction to Digital Soil Mapping of soil nutrients and associated soil attributes}\label{introduction-to-digital-soil-mapping-of-soil-nutrients-and-associated-soil-attributes}}

Digital soil mapping (DSM) is a methodological framework to create soil attribute maps on the basis of the quantitative relationships between spatial soil databases and environmental covariates. The quantitative relations can be modelled by different statistical approaches, most of them considered machine learning techniques. Environmental covariates are spatially explicit proxies of soil-forming factors that are employed as predictors of the geographical distribution of soil properties. The methodology has evolved from the theories of soil genesis developed by Vasil Dokuchaev in his work the Russian Chernozems (1883), which later were formalised by Jenny (1941) with the equation of the soil-forming factors. The conceptual equation of soil-forming factors has been updated by McBratney, Santos and Minasny (\protect\hyperlink{ref-McBratney2003}{2003}) as follow:

\begin{equation} 
  S = f\left(s,c,o,r,p,a,n\right)
  \label{eq:scorpan}
\end{equation}

Where \(S\) is the soil classes or attributes (to be modelled) as a function of ``\(s\)'' as other soil properties, ``\(c\)'' as climatic properties, ``\(o\)'' as organisms, including land cover and human activity, ``\(r\)'' as terrain attributes, ``\(p\)'' as parent material, ``\(a\)'' as soil age, and ``\(n\)'' as the geographic position.

Digital soil mapping has been used to produce maps of soil nutrients. For instance, Hengl \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hengl2017}{2017}) predicted 15 soil nutrients at a 250 m resolution in Africa, using a random forest model (Wright and Ziegler, 2016), topsoil nutrient observations at point locations and a set of spatially-explicit environmental covariates. In 2021, Hengl et al.~applied the same modelling approach to estimate total phosphorus in semi-natural soils at the global scale, as well.

In this technical manual, we present a DSM frameworks to map soil properties, including soil nutrients. One approach for soil observations with latitude and longitude data (point-support) (Figure \ref{fig:workflow1}).

Soil data consist of measurement at a specific geographical location, time and soil depth. Therefore, it is necessary to arrange the data following the format shown in Table \ref{tab:data1}.

Soil data usually require a preprocessing step to solve common issues such as, arranging the data format, fixing soil horizon depth consistency, detecting unusual soil property measurements, among others issues.
Once the original dataset is clean and consistent, data harmonisation is needed to produce synthetic horizons (such as 0-30 cm layer), as well as to make compatible measurements from different lab methods. Horizon harmonisation will be done with the mass preserving spline function (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bishop1999}{Bishop, McBratney and Laslett, 1999}; \protect\hyperlink{ref-Malone2009}{Malone \emph{et al.}, 2009}) fitted to each individual soil profile, which requires more than a layer per profile. In the cases of single-layer samples, which is common in sampling for nutrient determination, a pedotransfer function locally calibrated should be applied. Pedotransfer functions will be also required to harmonise the laboratory methods. Experts from GLOSOLAN will provide advice in this regard.

\section{Environmental covariates}\label{environmental-covariates}}

The SCORPAN equation (Eq. \ref{eq:scorpan}) refers to the soil-forming factors that determine the spatial variation of soils. However, these factors cannot be measured directly. Instead, proxies of these soil forming factors are used. One essential characteristic of the environmental covariates is that they are spatially explicit, covering the whole study area. Table 2 shows a summary of the environmental covariates that can be implemented under the DSM framework.

\end{longtable}

Apart from the environmental covariates mentioned in Table \ref{tab:covs}, other types of maps could also be included, such as Global Surface Water Mapping Layers and Water Soil Erosion from the Joint Research Centre (JRC). At national level there may be very significant covariates that could complement or replace the covariates of Table \ref{tab:covs}.

Since environmental covariates are available at different resolutions and coordinate reference systems (CRS), they have to be harmonised at a common resolution and CRS. The target resolution in GSNmap is 250 m x 250 m, therefore, all covariates were aggregated (from higher to lower resolution) or disaggregated (from lower to higher resolution) to 250 m. This process involved a raster resampling method, which is usually implemented by a bilinear approach for continuous covariates, and by the nearest-neighbour approach for categorical covariates (not included in the current list).

Note that the target resolution of GSNmap has been set at 250 m, which can be considered a moderate resolution for a global layer. However, those countries that require a higher resolution are free to develop higher resolution maps and aggregate the resulting maps to the target resolution of GSNmap for submission.

\hypertarget{reducing-collinearity-in-environmental-covariates}{%
\section{Reducing collinearity in environmental covariates}\label{reducing-collinearity-in-environmental-covariates}}

Multicollinearity is usually present in remote sensing data and terrain attributes. While this was an issue for multiple linear regression models, current models such as random forest can deal with high dimensionality. However, the main reasons to reduce the number of environmental covariates are that a model with fewer predictors can be interpreted more easily, thus extracting new knowledge, redundant information increasing the computational demand, and improve prediction results (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Behrens2014}{Behrens \emph{et al.}, 2014}).

Covariate selection can be done by supervised or unsupervised methods (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Behrens2010}{Behrens \emph{et al.}, 2010}). Supervised methods work on the basis of prediction results, hence they are based on a given dataset. For instance, recursive feature elimination (RFE) in caret R package (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kuhn2022}{Kuhn, 2022}) provides a tool for selecting covariates according to their predicting contribution. Instead, unsupervised methods are used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by removing redundant information without taking into account a particular target variable. Principal component analysis is one of the most widely used for this purpose, however, it does not ensure that specific discriminant features are kept within the main factors (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Behrens2014}{Behrens \emph{et al.}, 2014}). Another drawback of this technique is that model interpretation can be reduced when using factors instead of the original covariates.

\hypertarget{merging-soil-data-and-environmental-covariates}{%
\section{Merging soil data and environmental covariates}\label{merging-soil-data-and-environmental-covariates}}

A calibration dataset consists of soil observations and a matrix of predictors, where each row is a soil observation paired with the values of the corresponding covariates for the given spatial location. Some common issues and solution when merging soil observations and covariates are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mismatch of coordinate reference system (CRS): it requires to convert the CRS of point data to the raster or polygon covariate CRS.
\item
  Categorical covariates: some covariates may be categorical, such as land use/cover, legacy soil maps or geological maps. A common problem in this case is that some classes may not be sampled with any soil observation, causing an error when using the layer for prediction, since the model cannot predict over a class that was not part of the model calibration step. Also, because of the cross-validation procedure, it is advised to have, at least, three soil samples per class for the same reason.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{setting-up-repeated-k-fold-cross-validation}{%
\section{Setting up repeated k-fold cross validation}\label{setting-up-repeated-k-fold-cross-validation}}

Cross validation is one of the most used methods in DSM for assessing the overall accuracy of the resulting maps (Step 8, Figure 3). Since this is implemented along with the model calibration step, we explain the process at this stage.

Cross validation consists of randomly splitting the input data into a training set and a testing set. However, a unique testing dataset can bias the overall accuracy. Therefore, k-fold cross validation randomly splits the data into k parts, using 1/k part of it for testing and k-1/k part for training the model. In order to make the final model more robust in terms of parameter estimations, we include repetitions of this process. The final approach is called repeated k-fold cross-validation, where k will be equal to ten in this process. A graphical representation of the 10-fold cross validation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:cv}. Note that green balls represent the samples belonging to the testing set and yellow balls are samples of the training set. Each row is a splitting step of the 10-folds, while each block (repetitions) represent the repetition step.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/cv.pdf}
  \caption{Schematic representation of the repeated cross-validation process.}
  \label{fig:cv}
\end{figure}

Step 5 in Figure 3 represents the repeated cross-validation, but note that after each single splitting step (the rows in Figure 4) the training data go to model calibration, which will be explained in Step 6 (next Section), and the testing data will be used with the calibrated model to produce the residuals (Step 8, Section 2.2.8).
Repeated cross validation has been nicely implemented in the caret R package (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kuhn2022}{Kuhn, 2022}), along with several calibration methods.

\hypertarget{model-calibration}{%
\section{Model calibration}\label{model-calibration}}

The model calibration step involves the use of a statistical model to find the relations between soil observations and environmental covariates. One of the most widely used models in DSM is random forest (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Breiman2001}{Breiman, 2001}). Random forest is considered a machine learning method which belongs to the decision-tree type of model. Random forest creates an ensemble of trees using a random selection of covariate. The prediction of a single tree is made based on the observed samples mean in the leaf. The random forest prediction is made by taking the average of the predictions of the single trees. The size of the number of covariates at each tree (mtry) can be fine-tuned before calibrating the model.

Quantile regression forests (QRF, Meinshausen (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Meinshausen2006}{2006})) are a generalisation of the random forest models, capable of not only predicting the conditional mean, but also the conditional probability density function. This feature allows one to estimate the standard deviation of the prediction, as well as the likelihood of the target variable falling below a given threshold. In a context where a minimum level of a soil nutrient concentration may be decisive for improving the crop yield, this feature can play an important role for the GSNmap initiative.

Model calibration will be implemented using the caret package (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kuhn2022}{Kuhn, 2022}). While we suggest to use QRF, caret provides a large set of models \url{https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-} models.html\#) that might perform better in specific cases. In this regard, it is up to the user to implement a different model, ensuring the product specifications (Section Product Specifications).

\hypertarget{predicting-soil-attributes}{%
\section{Predicting soil attributes}\label{predicting-soil-attributes}}

After calibrating the model, caret will select the best set of parameters and will fit the model using the whole dataset. Then, the final model can be used to predict the target soil properties. The process uses the model and the values of the covariates at target locations. This is generally done by using the same input covariates as a multilayer raster format, ensuring that the names of the layers are the same as the covariates in the calibration dataset. In this step we will predict the conditional mean and conditional standard deviation at each raster cell.

\hypertarget{step-4-uncertainty-assessment}{%
\chapter{Step 4: uncertainty assessment}\label{step-4-uncertainty-assessment}}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Accuracy assessment is an essential step in digital soil mapping. One aspect of the accuracy assessment has been done in Step 7 by predicting the standard deviation of the prediction, which shows the spatial pattern of the uncertainty. Another aspect of the uncertainty is the estimation of the overall accuracy to measure the model performance. This will be measured using the model residuals generated by caret during the repeated cross validation step.

The residuals produced by caret consist of tabular data with observed and predicted values of the target soil property. They can be used to estimate different accuracy statistics. Wadoux, Walvoort and Brus (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wadoux2022}{2022}) have reviewed and evaluated many of them. While they concluded that there is not a single accuracy statistic that can explain all aspect of map quality, they recommended the following:
mean prediction error (ME), that estimates the prediction bias;
mean absolute prediction error (MAE) and root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) to estimate the magnitude of the errors; and
model efficiency coefficient (MEC) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Janssen1995}{Janssen and Heuberger, 1995}) as an estimator of the proportion of variance explained by the model.

While solar diagrams (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wadoux2022}{Wadoux, Walvoort and Brus, 2022}) are desired, we propose to produce a scatterplot of the observed vs predicted values maintaining the same range and scale for the X and Y axes.

Finally, note that accuracy assessment has been discussed in Wadoux \emph{et al.} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wadoux2021}{2021}), since the spatial distribution of soil samples might constrain the validity of the accuracy statistics. This is especially true in cases where the spatial distribution of observations is clustered. The authors recommended creating a kriging map of residuals before using them for assessing the map quality.
