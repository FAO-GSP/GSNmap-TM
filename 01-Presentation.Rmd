# Presentation

##	Background and Objectives
Soil nutrient availability can affect ecosystem carbon cycling, plant phenology, plant diversity and community composition, plant-herbivore and plant-soil-microbe interactions, as well as the structure of trophic food webs [@vanSundert2020]. Thus, the broad range of effects of nutrient availability also affects ecosystem functioning in face of global changes, for instance the response of plants to elevated levels of CO~2~ [@vicca2018]. 

In the context of agriculture, nutrient availability modulates crop productivity and thus food production. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, current conflicts and devastating extreme weather events triggered by climate change jeopardise achieving sustainable development goal (SDG) 2 (Zero Hunger) by 2030. To date, a total number of around 2.3 billion people are affected by moderate and severe food insecurity [@FAO2022]. Despite soil nutrient status and availability being vital to the provisioning of ecosystem services, globally-accessible and harmonised datasets on soil nutrient stocks and soil properties that govern nutrient availability are missing. 

Therefore, the current global situation requires an increase of food production while preserving natural (soil) resources, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and optimising the use of goods such as fertilisers on agricultural sites [@eisenstein2020]. Fertiliser prices more than doubled within one year and grain prices increased by around 25 percent (Jan. 2021 - Jan. 2022) [@ifpri2020]. With the start of the armed conflict in Ukraine in February 2022, this trend became more pronounced.
Growing food insecurity and rapidly increasing fertiliser prices underscore the urgent need for informed decision-making and optimised soil nutrient management. However, a large data gap exists in regards to soil nutrient stocks and soil properties that govern nutrient availability. Therefore, FAO’s Global Soil Partnership (GSP) has launched the Global Soil Nutrient and Nutrient Budget map (GSNmap) initiative in an endeavour to provide harmonised and finely resolved soil nutrient data and information to stakeholders following a country-driven approach.
Up-to-date soil data on the status and spatial trends of soil nutrients and related soil attributes is key to guide policy-making to close yield gaps, and protect local natural resources. Therefore, locally-specific optimisation of soil nutrient and agricultural management are needed [@cunningham2013]. The soil information collected in the GSNmap thereby serves as a cornerstone in delineating priority areas for action and thereby seizes the opportunity to reduce food insecurity, close yield gaps, and reduce environmental costs arising from mismanagement of soil nutrients and especially overfertilisation.

## Global Soil Partnership
The Global Soil Partnership (GSP) was established in December 2012 as a mechanism to develop a strong interactive partnership and to enhance collaboration and generate synergies between all stakeholders to raise awareness and protect the world’s soil resources. From land users to policymakers, one of the main objectives of GSP is to improve governance and promote sustainable management of soils. Since its creation, GSP has become an important partnership platform where global soil issues are discussed and addressed by multiple stakeholders at different levels. 

The mandate of GSP is to improve governance of the planet’s limited soil resources in order to guarantee productive agricultural soils for a food-secure world. In addition, it supports other essential soil ecosystem services in accordance with the sovereign right of each Member State over its natural resources. In order to achieve its mandate, GSP addresses six thematic action areas  to be implemented in collaboration with its regional soil partnerships (Figure 1).

The area of work on Soil Information and Data (SID) of the GSP builds an enduring and authoritative global system (GloSIS) to monitor and forecast the condition of the Earth's soil resources and produce map products at the global level. The secretariat is working with the  international network of soil data providers (INSII - International Network of Soil Information Institutions) to implement data related activities. 

## Country-driven approach and tasks

The GSNmap initiative will be jointly implemented by the International Network of Soil Information Institutions (INSII) and the GSP Secretariat. The process will be country-driven, involving and supporting all Member States in developing their national GSNmap data products. The GSNmap products will be developed following a two phase approach:

* Phase I: development of soil nutrient and associated soil property maps;
* Phase II: quantification, analysis, projections of nutrient budgets for agricultural land use systems at national, regional and global scale. 

These guidelines only concern GSNmap Phase I, while the guidelines for the GSNmap Phase II will be published in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Technical Manual covers the generation of soil property maps for the soil attributes specified in table \@ref(tab:overview_prop). It is based on the contribution of each element to the average plant content.



```{r overview_prop, echo = FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
options(knitr.table.format = "HTML")
library(readxl)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- read_xlsx("tables/wosis_dist.xlsx")
kable(booktabs = T, dt[,c("Soil property","property_id","Unit" )], col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(dt[,c("Soil property","property_id","Unit" )])), caption = 'Mandatory soil attributes and units of the phase I Global Soil Nutrient and Nutrient Budget Maps', format = 'html') %>%
kable_classic(full_width = F)
```
Depending on national data availability and technical capacities, ad-hoc solutions will be developed by the GSNmap WG to support countries during the national GSNmap production and/or harmonisation phase. Where possible, GSP Secretariat will use publicly available data to gap-fill the areas which are not covered by the national submissions unless the country requests to be left blank on the GSNmap products.

## How to use this book

The present document is a technical manual on the phase I of the GSNmap initiative. It provides the scientific background on the importance of soil nutrients and guidance on the digital soil mapping techniques to map nutrients and soil properties that govern nutrient availability. It also comprises a compendium with all necessary scripts to generate national GSNmaps. These scripts are described step-by-step in 4 steps that cover soil data preparation (Step 1), covariate download (Step 2), the mapping process itself (Step 3), and the automatic generation of national reports (Step 4). The general workflow is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:steps).

```{r steps, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Overview of the steps to follow for the GSNmap generation."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Manual-Workflow.png")

```

The chapters are structured as following:

* Chapter 1 provides general information about the GSNmap initiative as another activity of the GSP.
* Chapter 2 focuses on the scientific state-of-the-art in terms of soil nutrients and soil nutrient mapping.
* Chapter 3 and 4 introduce the software requirements and the concept of digital soil mapping.
* Chapter 5 to 7 guide the reader through the nutrient mapping exercise of GSNmap Phase I providing step-by-step instructions.
* Chapter 8 explains how the national GSNmaps are reported to the GSP.
* Annex I serves as a repository for the complete scripts needed for the GSNmap.
* Annex II provides alternative step-by-step instructions for the special case of soil data without point coordinates.

The GSNmap Technical Manual is structured as a practical document to be used by national experts in the endeavour to employ digital soil mapping techniques to generate national nutrient maps based on a common methodology. The concept of digital soil mapping presented here can however be also used in mapping exercises that focus on other soil properties and is therefore also relevant to scientists and digital soil mappers.
