# Reporting results

The GSNmap consists of a set of mandatory and optional maps that are to be generated as raster files (GeoTiff) at a resolution of 250 x 250 m.

Mandatory data products are:

* total N
* available P
* available K
* CEC
* soil pH
* clay, silt, and sand
* soil organic carbon concentration
* bulk density

Optional products are the same products but for depths at 30-60 and 60-100 cm. Additionally, layers on micronutrients such as Ca, S, Mg, Fe, B, Cl, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, and Ni can be provided.

We provide a .Rmd file were the user needs to set the `soilatt` variable and the path to the data used as input.

Then, run the following code:

```{r rmd, eval=FALSE}
# 1 - Open the file C:/GIT/GSNmap-TM/Digital-Soil-Mapping/Report_k.Rmd
# 2 - adjust the content
# 3 - Run the following code
path = 'C:/GIT/GSNmap-TM/Digital-Soil-Mapping/Report_k.Rmd'
output_format = 'pdf_document'
output_file = paste0("Report_", soilatt,".pdf")

rmarkdown::render(path, output_format, output_file)
```

The output report document is to be submitted along with the layers using a submission form provided by the GSP Secretariat.
