# Annex IV: Quality assurance and quality control {-}
The following protocol was devised to provide National Experts with a step-by-step guideline to perform a Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) of the 10 GSNmap first phase products.

The following protocol does not provide any guidance in terms of uncertainty estimation and validation. For more details and information on the estimation of uncertainties and potential map validation strategies please refer to Chapter 8.4.

Quality assurance and quality control consist of activities to ensure the quality of a particular result. Quality control is a reactive process that focuses on identifying defects and errors while quality assurance is a proactive approach aimed at preventing defects and errors. In the context of digital soil mapping, both processes are often interlinked. A QA is interlinked with a QC when it identifies defects and the QA remodels the process to eliminate the defects and prevent them from recurring (Chapman, 2005)(Figure\@ref(fig:qaqc)).

```{r qaqc, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Quality assurance and quality control."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/QA_QC.png")
```

Each step in the following protocol should be considered in order to detect and eliminate errors, address data inaccuracies and assess the output completeness.

## Step 1: Completeness of layers {-}

The following Table \ref(tab:products) gives an overview of all the GSNmap products in alphabetical order. Each product should include the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code as uppercase letters in its name. For instance, in the case of Turkiye, ISO_GSNmap_Ntot_Map030 should be changed to TUR_GSNmap_Ntot_Map030.

All 10 soil property and soil nutrient maps with their corresponding 10 uncertainty layers must be georeferenced TIF (.tif) files.

```{r products, echo = FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
options(knitr.table.format = "HTML")
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- read.csv("tables/Table_Product-overview.csv", sep = ",")
kable(booktabs = T, dt, col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(dt)), caption = '\\label{tab:products}Data product overview.', format = 'html') %>%
kable_classic(full_width = F) %>%
  #kable_styling(latex_options = 'striped', font_size = 10) %>%
  kableExtra::group_rows(group_label = "Major nutrients (3 files)", start_row = 1, end_row = 3) %>%
  kableExtra::group_rows(group_label = "Associated soil properties (7 files)", start_row = 4, end_row = 10) %>% 
  kableExtra::group_rows(group_label = "Uncertainty maps (10 files)", start_row = 11, end_row = 20)
```

## Step 2: Check the projection and resolution of all data products {-}
Open the products in QGIS or any other preferred GIS platform. Check that the projection of all products is EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 (Layer properties). Check that the spatial resolution (pixel size) (Layer properties) is equal to ~0.002246 degrees ; 250 m x 250 m at the equator.

## Step 3: Check the extent {-}
Visualize the 20 products in QGIS or any preferred GIS platform. Load a land-use layer to visually assess that the simulations were done exclusively on croplands.

## Step 4: Check the units, ranges, and outliers {-}

In the following section possible value ranges for each product category (except available potassium) are presented. It is important to note that the provided ranges represent a gross approximation of the extremes within which the values should fall in. Results that fall outside these ranges need to be carefully evaluated based on local expertise and available literature.

The provided ranges can be compared in QGIS, R, or any preferred platform. Descriptive layer statistics can be viewed in QGIS under Layer Properties.

The following table (Table 10.2) presents ranges of possible values for 9 of the 10 mandatory GSNmap products. The ranges were calculated based on the distribution of the soil profile data within the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS), specifically the WoSIS snapshot 2019 (Batjes, N. H. *et al.* 2020). It is important to note that the data was not filtered for croplands and that the ranges were extracted from soil profiles sampled globally from a wide array of land covers and land uses. 

```{r ranges, echo = FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
library(readxl)
options(knitr.table.format = "HTML")
dt <- read_xlsx("tables/wosis_dist.xlsx")
kable(booktabs = T, dt, col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(dt)), caption = '\\label{tab:ranges}Possible soil property and soil nutrient values based on the distribution of the values within the World Soil Information Service (WoSIS), specifically the WoSIS snapshot 2019.', format = 'html') %>%
kable_classic(full_width = F)
```
